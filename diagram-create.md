Q: Many were asking me how others make good-looking animated diagrams and how they too can do it.
(tutorial 👨‍🏫📓 links below) ⬇
A: This is not something new, in fact, it's been there for many years, but a few people recently made very beautiful and interactive diagrams with it. 

So now, if you would like to learn how to make such good-looking animated diagrams here are some good resources:

Hope this will be useful for many who would like to learn how to make such things and ask questions to authors but get no answers from them.
