# API Gateway

An API Gateway is a server that acts as a single entry point for managing, aggregating and routing API requests.

It's the Key to efficiently handling API traffic, ensuring security and optimizing performance. 🚀


The API Gateway Architecture consists of several layers, each serving a unique purpose. Here are top 4 layers -

1️⃣ 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 🛡️:
This layer takes care of protecting your API infrastructure from threats. It enforces security policies such as SSL/TLS, DDoS protection, and rate limiting, ensuring that your APIs are not vulnerable to unauthorized access or misuse.


2️⃣ 𝗔𝗱𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 🛠️:
Managing APIs is no small task. That's where the Administrative Layer comes in. It provides features for API versioning, monitoring, logging, and analytics. With these tools, you can keep track of API usage, diagnose issues, and gain insights into how your APIs are performing.

3️⃣ 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 🗝️:
Controlling who gets access to your APIs is crucial. The Access Layer handles authentication, authorization, and access control policies. Whether it's through API keys, OAuth tokens, or other mechanisms, you have the power to decide who can access your APIs and what they can do.

4️⃣ 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 🔄:
APIs come in all shapes and sizes, and it's not always easy to make them work together. The Transformation Layer helps by providing tools for data transformation and protocol conversion. Whether you need to convert JSON to XML, handle different authentication schemes, or support legacy systems, this layer has got you covered.

✅ Edge Gateways: Placed on the outer layer of your network, they handle public APIs, focusing on load balancing, security, and caching.

✅ Internal Gateways: Catering to internal APIs, they help optimize inter-service communication and manage internal API traffic.

✅ Micro-Gateways: Lightweight and tailored for specific use cases, they're deployed in close proximity to specific services, often within containerized environments.
