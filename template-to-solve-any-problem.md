Approaching system design problems can be harder than coding problems.

For one reason: ambiguity.

13 concepts to use when solving a system design problem:

𝟬. 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿:

A load balancer efficiently distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much load.

𝟭. 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗚𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘄𝗮𝘆:

An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests, providing a unified interface to various microservices.

𝟮. 𝗖𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲:

Caching stores recently accessed data for speedy retrieval, reducing the load on databases and improving response times.

𝟯. 𝗖𝗗𝗡:

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) stores static content closer to users to minimize latency and speed up content delivery.

𝟰. 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗙𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲:

Distributed file storage ensures data is redundantly stored across multiple locations for fault tolerance and easy access.

𝟱. 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗲𝘅:

Using a search index like Elasticsearch allows for scalable and fast search capabilities across large datasets.

𝟲. 𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲:

A notification service handles the delivery of messages or alerts to users across different platforms and devices.

𝟳. 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀:

Data processing systems like Hadoop and Spark analyze large volumes of data, enabling scalable and complex computational operations.

𝟴. 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲𝗿: 

A distributed scheduler orchestrates and manages the execution of distributed tasks across various computing resources.

𝟵. 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿:

The metadata server stores information about the structure of data, enabling efficient access and management.

𝟭𝟬. 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿:

Block servers manage the storage blocks in distributed file systems, which helps in data replication and retrieval.

𝟭𝟭. 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴:

Distributed logging collects logs from various services in a centralized manner for monitoring and troubleshooting.

𝟭𝟮. 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴:

Replication ensures data availability and durability, while partitioning helps in scaling databases by distributing data across different nodes.
