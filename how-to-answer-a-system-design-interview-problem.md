step 1:  Clarify the requirements
  Listen carefully and ask questions to identify all key features.
  There are two types of requirements we should clarify.
  1. Functionality
  2. Non-Functionality

  Question to ask to clarify the requirements:
  Functional
  1. What are the core feature system should support
  2. Are there any particulor feature that are more criticle than others
  3. Who will use this system?
  4. what specific actions user should be able to perform on the system?
  5. how will user interact with the system?
  6. Does the system need to support multiple languages or locals
  7. what are the key data types the system must handle. it can influence your data base
  8. are there any external systems or third party services needs to integrate with?

  Non-Functional
  1. What is the expected scale of system in terms of users and reuests?
  2. How much data volumes is expected to be handled by the systems
  3.  what are the inputs and outputs of the systems?
  4.  what is the expected read to write ratio?
  5.  Can the system can have Downtime or Does it need to high availability?
  6.  Are there any specific latency requirements?
  7.  how criticle is data consistancy? can some eventual data consistancy can be tolerated for the sake of availability?
  8.  Are there any non-functional requirements(scalability, performance, reliability) we should focus on?

step 2 : capacity estimation
