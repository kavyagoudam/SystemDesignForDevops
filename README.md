The best way to learn to build software, is to build real software.

But often it’s hard to know what to build, so we end up spending time looking for ideas instead of building and learning.

There are two solutions to this problem. Firstly, contribute to an open source project - do a Google search for ‘Good First Issue’ visit one of the top results and look for a project that interests you.

However many people give up on open source option because it’s not easy to find that right combination of:

1. an active project,
2. that interests you,
3. is in the programming language you want to use, and
4. has an open issue that you can tackle.

If that's the case, then the second way is to build a clone of an existing application or system. Either something you already use, or you can do one of my Coding Challenges:

⇢ Build your own Redis server - https://lnkd.in/eHRCAmCE
⇢ Build your own URL shortener - https://lnkd.in/ezCc8EFR
⇢ Build your own Application Load Balancer - https://lnkd.in/eiBRVHNu
⇢ Build your own DNS Resolver - https://lnkd.in/eUB3nyxC
⇢ Build your own Git Client - https://lnkd.in/eG6jYyRm
⇢ Build your own Scheduling App - https://lnkd.in/eKDSRhdS
⇢ Build your own Rate Limiter - https://lnkd.in/e2C2RB4M
⇢ Build your own Message Broker - https://lnkd.in/eaFGTxKT
⇢ Build your own Web Server - https://lnkd.in/ezBDppnb
⇢ Build your own Memcached server - https://lnkd.in/esGquJTy
⇢ Build your own IRC client - https://lnkd.in/eqWfX_JR
⇢ Build your own Discord Bot - https://lnkd.in/emAymj8b
⇢ Build your own compression tool using Huffman encoding - https://lnkd.in/e4WcUyYy
⇢ Build your own Spotify client - https://lnkd.in/eGDB9zgN
⇢ Build a JSON parser - https://lnkd.in/ejWVe4H6

People are solving the challenges in Rust, Clojure, Python, C, C#, C++, Java, Go and Dart.

If you fancy giving them a go, you can click on any of the links above or to get future challenges sent directly to you, you can subscribe to the Coding Challenges newsletter here: https://lnkd.in/e4S487pP
